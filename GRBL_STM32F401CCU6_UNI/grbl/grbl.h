// Some status report data isn't necessary for realtime, only intermittently, because the values don't
// change often. The following macros configures how many times a status report needs to be called before
// the associated data is refreshed and included in the status report. However, if one of these value
// changes, Grbl will automatically include this data in the next status report, regardless of what the
// count is at the time. This helps reduce the communication overhead involved with high frequency reporting
// and aggressive streaming. There is also a busy and an idle refresh count, which sets up Grbl to send
// refreshes more often when its not doing anything important. With a good GUI, this data doesn't need
// to be refreshed very often, on the order of a several seconds.
// NOTE: WCO refresh must be 2 or greater. OVERRIDE refresh must be 1 or greater.
//#define REPORT_OVERRIDE_REFRESH_BUSY_COUNT 20   // (1-255)

// The temporal resolution of the acceleration management subsystem. A higher number gives smoother
// acceleration, particularly noticeable on machines that run at very high feedrates, but may negatively
// impact performance. The correct value for this parameter is machine dependent, so it's advised to
// set this only as high as needed. Approximate successful values can widely range from 50 to 200 or more.
// NOTE: Changing this value also changes the execution time of a segment in the step segment buffer.
// When increasing this value, this stores less overall time in the segment buffer and vice versa. Make
// certain the step segment buffer is increased/decreased to account for these changes.
//#define ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND 100

// Adaptive Multi-Axis Step Smoothing (AMASS) is an advanced feature that does what its name implies,
// smoothing the stepping of multi-axis motions. This feature smooths motion particularly at low step
// frequencies below 10kHz, where the aliasing between axes of multi-axis motions can cause audible
// noise and shake your machine. At even lower step frequencies, AMASS adapts and provides even better
// step smoothing. See stepper.c for more details on the AMASS system works.
#define ADAPTIVE_MULTI_AXIS_STEP_SMOOTHING  // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// Define Adaptive Multi-Axis Step-Smoothing(AMASS) levels and cutoff frequencies. The highest level
// frequency bin starts at 0Hz and ends at its cutoff frequency. The next lower level frequency bin
// starts at the next higher cutoff frequency, and so on. The cutoff frequencies for each level must
// be considered carefully against how much it over-drives the stepper ISR, the accuracy of the 16-bit
// timer, and the CPU overhead. Level 0 (no AMASS, normal operation) frequency bin starts at the
// Level 1 cutoff frequency and up to as fast as the CPU allows (over 30kHz in limited testing).
// NOTE: AMASS cutoff frequency multiplied by ISR overdrive factor must not exceed maximum step frequency.
// NOTE: Current settings are set to overdrive the ISR to no more than 16kHz, balancing CPU overhead
// and timer accuracy.  Do not alter these settings unless you know what you are doing.

// check in the settings module to prevent settings values that will exceed this limitation. The maximum

// With this enabled, Grbl sends back an echo of the line it has received, which has been pre-parsed (spaces
// removed, capitalized letters, no comments) and is to be immediately executed by Grbl. Echoes will not be
// sent upon a line buffer overflow, but should for all normal lines sent to Grbl. For example, if a user
// sendss the line 'g1 x1.032 y2.45 (test comment)', Grbl will echo back in the form '[echo: G1X1.032Y2.45]'.
// NOTE: Only use this for debugging purposes!! When echoing, this takes up valuable resources and can effect

// ADVANCED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

// Enables code for debugging purposes. Not for general use and always in constant flux.
//#define DEBUG // Uncomment to enable. Default disabled.
//#define DEBUGOUT 0 // Uncomment to claim serial port with given instance number and add HAL entry point for debug output.

// Some status report data isn't necessary for realtime, only intermittently, because the values don't
// change often. The following macros configures how many times a status report needs to be called before
// the associated data is refreshed and included in the status report. However, if one of these value
// changes, Grbl will automatically include this data in the next status report, regardless of what the
// count is at the time. This helps reduce the communication overhead involved with high frequency reporting
// and aggressive streaming. There is also a busy and an idle refresh count, which sets up Grbl to send
// refreshes more often when its not doing anything important. With a good GUI, this data doesn't need
// to be refreshed very often, on the order of a several seconds.
// NOTE: WCO refresh must be 2 or greater. OVERRIDE refresh must be 1 or greater.
//#define REPORT_OVERRIDE_REFRESH_BUSY_COUNT 20   // (1-255)
//#define REPORT_OVERRIDE_REFRESH_IDLE_COUNT 10   // (1-255) Must be less than or equal to the busy count
//#define REPORT_WCO_REFRESH_BUSY_COUNT 30        // (2-255)
//#define REPORT_WCO_REFRESH_IDLE_COUNT 10        // (2-255) Must be less than or equal to the busy count

// The temporal resolution of the acceleration management subsystem. A higher number gives smoother
// acceleration, particularly noticeable on machines that run at very high feedrates, but may negatively
// impact performance. The correct value for this parameter is machine dependent, so it's advised to
// set this only as high as needed. Approximate successful values can widely range from 50 to 200 or more.
// NOTE: Changing this value also changes the execution time of a segment in the step segment buffer.
// When increasing this value, this stores less overall time in the segment buffer and vice versa. Make
// certain the step segment buffer is increased/decreased to account for these changes.
//#define ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND 100

// Sets the maximum step rate allowed to be written as a Grbl setting. This option enables an error
// check in the settings module to prevent settings values that will exceed this limitation. The maximum
// step rate is strictly limited by the CPU speed and will change if something other than an AVR running
// at 16MHz is used.
// NOTE: For now disabled, will enable if flash space permits.
//#define MAX_STEP_RATE_HZ 30000 // Hz

// With this enabled, Grbl sends back an echo of the line it has received, which has been pre-parsed (spaces
// removed, capitalized letters, no comments) and is to be immediately executed by Grbl. Echoes will not be
// sent upon a line buffer overflow, but should for all normal lines sent to Grbl. For example, if a user
// sendss the line 'g1 x1.032 y2.45 (test comment)', Grbl will echo back in the form '[echo: G1X1.032Y2.45]'.
// NOTE: Only use this for debugging purposes!! When echoing, this takes up valuable resources and can effect
// performance. If absolutely needed for normal operation, the serial write buffer should be greatly increased
// to help minimize transmission waiting within the serial write protocol.
//#define REPORT_ECHO_LINE_RECEIVED // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Sets which axis the tool length offset is applied. Assumes the spindle is always parallel with
// the selected axis with the tool oriented toward the negative direction. In other words, a positive
// tool length offset value is subtracted from the current location.
//#define TOOL_LENGTH_OFFSET_AXIS Z_AXIS // Default z-axis. Valid values are X_AXIS, Y_AXIS, or Z_AXIS.

// Minimum planner junction speed. Sets the default minimum junction speed the planner plans to at
// every buffer block junction, except for starting from rest and end of the buffer, which are always
// zero. This value controls how fast the machine moves through junctions with no regard for acceleration
// limits or angle between neighboring block line move directions. This is useful for machines that can't
// tolerate the tool dwelling for a split second, i.e. 3d printers or laser cutters. If used, this value
// should not be much greater than zero or to the minimum value necessary for the machine to work.
//#define MINIMUM_JUNCTION_SPEED 0.0f // (mm/min)

// Sets the minimum feed rate the planner will allow. Any value below it will be set to this minimum
// value. This also ensures that a planned motion always completes and accounts for any floating-point
// round-off errors. Although not recommended, a lower value than 1.0 mm/min will likely work in smaller
// machines, perhaps to 0.1mm/min, but your success may vary based on multiple factors.
//#define MINIMUM_FEED_RATE 1.0f // (mm/min)

// Number of arc generation iterations by small angle approximation before exact arc trajectory
// correction with expensive sin() and cos() calculations. This parameter maybe decreased if there
// are issues with the accuracy of the arc generations, or increased if arc execution is getting
// bogged down by too many trig calculations.
//#define N_ARC_CORRECTION 12 // Integer (1-255)

// The arc G2/3 g-code standard is problematic by definition. Radius-based arcs have horrible numerical
// errors when arc at semi-circles(pi) or full-circles(2*pi). Offset-based arcs are much more accurate
// but still have a problem when arcs are full-circles (2*pi). This define accounts for the floating
// point issues when offset-based arcs are commanded as full circles, but get interpreted as extremely
// small arcs with around machine epsilon (1.2e-7rad) due to numerical round-off and precision issues.
// This define value sets the machine epsilon cutoff to determine if the arc is a full-circle or not.
// NOTE: Be very careful when adjusting this value. It should always be greater than 1.2e-7 but not too
// much greater than this. The default setting should capture most, if not all, full arc error situations.

// Time delay increments performed during a dwell. The default value is set at 50ms, which provides
// a maximum time delay of roughly 55 minutes, more than enough for most any application. Increasing
// this delay will increase the maximum dwell time linearly, but also reduces the responsiveness of
// run-time command executions, like status reports, since these are performed between each dwell
// time step.
//#define DWELL_TIME_STEP 50 // Integer (1-255) (milliseconds)

// The number of linear motions in the planner buffer to be planned at any give time. The vast
// majority of RAM that Grbl uses is based on this buffer size. Only increase if there is extra
// available RAM, like when re-compiling for MCU with ample amounts of RAM. Or decrease if the MCU begins to
// crash due to the lack of available RAM or if the CPU is having trouble keeping up with planning
// new incoming motions as they are executed.
//#define BLOCK_BUFFER_SIZE 36 // Uncomment to override default in planner.h.

// Governs the size of the intermediary step segment buffer between the step execution algorithm
// and the planner blocks. Each segment is set of steps executed at a constant velocity over a
// fixed time defined by ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND. They are computed such that the planner
// block velocity profile is traced exactly. The size of this buffer governs how much step
// execution lead time there is for other Grbl processes have to compute and do their thing
// before having to come back and refill this buffer, currently at ~50msec of step moves.
//#define SEGMENT_BUFFER_SIZE 10 // Uncomment to override default in stepper.h.

// Configures the position after a probing cycle during Grbl's check mode. Disabled sets
// the position to the probe target, when enabled sets the position to the start position.
//#define SET_CHECK_MODE_PROBE_TO_START // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Force Grbl to check the state of the hard limit switches when the processor detects a pin
// change inside the hard limit ISR routine. By default, Grbl will trigger the hard limits
// alarm upon any pin change, since bouncing switches can cause a state check like this to
// misread the pin. When hard limits are triggered, they should be 100% reliable, which is the
// reason that this option is disabled by default. Only if your system/electronics can guarantee
// that the switches don't bounce, we recommend enabling this option. This will help prevent
// triggering a hard limit when the machine disengages from the switch.
// NOTE: This option has no effect if SOFTWARE_DEBOUNCE is enabled.
//#define HARD_LIMIT_FORCE_STATE_CHECK // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Adjusts homing cycle search and locate scalars. These are the multipliers used by Grbl's
// homing cycle to ensure the limit switches are engaged and cleared through each phase of
// the cycle. The search phase uses the axes max-travel setting times the SEARCH_SCALAR to
// determine distance to look for the limit switch. Once found, the locate phase begins and
// uses the homing pull-off distance setting times the LOCATE_SCALAR to pull-off and re-engage
// the limit switch.
// NOTE: Both of these values must be greater than 1.0 to ensure proper function.
//#define HOMING_AXIS_SEARCH_SCALAR  1.5f // Uncomment to override defaults in limits.c.

// Enable the '$RST=*', '$RST=$', and '$RST=#' non-volatile storage restore commands. There are cases where
// these commands may be undesirable. Simply comment the desired macro to disable it.
// NOTE: See SETTINGS_RESTORE_ALL macro for customizing the `$RST=*` command.

// Defines the non-volatile data restored upon a settings version change and `$RST=*` command. Whenever the
// the settings or other non-volatile data structure changes between Grbl versions, Grbl will automatically
// wipe and restore the non-volatile data. These macros controls what data is wiped and restored. This is useful
// particularly for OEMs that need to retain certain data. For example, the BUILD_INFO string can be
// written into non-volatile storage via a separate program to contain product data. Altering these
// macros to not restore the build info non-volatile storage will ensure this data is retained after firmware upgrades.

// Enable the '$I=(string)' build info write command. If disabled, any existing build info data must
// be placed into non-volatile storage via external means with a valid checksum value. This macro option is useful
// to prevent this data from being over-written by a user, when used to store OEM product data.
// NOTE: If disabled and to ensure Grbl can never alter the build info line, you'll also need to enable
// the SETTING_RESTORE_ALL macro above and remove SETTINGS_RESTORE_BUILD_INFO from the mask.
// NOTE: See the included grblWrite_BuildInfo.ino example file to write this string separately.
//#define DISABLE_BUILD_INFO_WRITE_COMMAND // '$I=' Default enabled. Uncomment to disable.

// Enables and configures Grbl's sleep mode feature. If the spindle or coolant are powered and Grbl
// is not actively moving or receiving any commands, a sleep timer will start. If any data or commands
// are received, the sleep timer will reset and restart until the above condition are not satisfied.
// If the sleep timer elaspes, Grbl will immediately execute the sleep mode by shutting down the spindle
// and coolant and entering a safe sleep state. If parking is enabled, Grbl will park the machine as
// well. While in sleep mode, only a hard/soft reset will exit it and the job will be unrecoverable.
// NOTE: Sleep mode is a safety feature, primarily to address communication disconnect problems. To
// keep Grbl from sleeping, employ a stream of '?' status report commands as a connection "heartbeat".
//#define SLEEP_ENABLE  // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.
//#define SLEEP_DURATION 5.0f // Number of minutes before sleep mode is entered.

// Disable non-volatile storage emulation/buffering in RAM (allocated from heap)

// When the HAL driver supports spindle sync then this option sets the number of pulses per revolution
// for the spindle encoder. Depending on the driver this may lead to the "spindle at speed" detection
// being enabled. When this is enabled grbl will wait for the spindle to reach the programmed speed
// before continue processing. NOTE: Currently there is no timeout for this wait.
// Default value is 0, meaning spindle sync is disabled
//#define DEFAULT_SPINDLE_PPR 0 // Pulses per revolution. Default 0.

// This option will automatically disable the laser during a feed hold by invoking a spindle stop
// override immediately after coming to a stop. However, this also means that the laser still may
// be re-enabled by disabling the spindle stop override, if needed. This is purely a safety feature
// to ensure the laser doesn't inadvertently remain powered while at a stop and cause a fire.
//#define DEFAULT_ENABLE_LASER_DURING_HOLD // Default enabled. Uncomment to disable.

//#define DEFAULT_NO_RESTORE_AFTER_FEED_HOLD // Default enabled. Uncomment to disable.

// When Grbl powers-cycles or is hard reset with the MCU reset button, Grbl boots up with no ALARM
// by default. This is to make it as simple as possible for new users to start using Grbl. When homing
// is enabled and a user has installed limit switches, Grbl will boot up in an ALARM state to indicate
// Grbl doesn't know its position and to force the user to home before proceeding. This option forces
// Grbl to always initialize into an ALARM state regardless of homing or not. This option is more for
// OEMs and LinuxCNC users that would like this power-cycle behavior.
//#define DEFAULT_FORCE_INITIALIZATION_ALARM // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// At power-up or a reset, Grbl will check the limit switch states to ensure they are not active

// If your machine has two limits switches wired in parallel to one axis, you will need to enable
